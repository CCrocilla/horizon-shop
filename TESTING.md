  - #### List of Automated Test Cases performed:
#### The Automation testing is the process of testing the software (as well as other tech products) to ensure it meets the requirements. In Horizon Shop 19 Automated Tests have been designed and run, all with positive final results. 

#### The Tests have been included in a tests folder for each app and have been divided by type allowing a better visualization of the tests carried out. See below for further details:

- Urls Automation Testing: The urls tests aim to ensure that all the urls in the application are functioning correctly calling the matched View.

- Views Automation Testing: The aim of the Views Automation Testing is to ensure that once the views are called they return a status code 200 meaning that the View is working correctly.

- Forms Automation Testing: The aim of the Forms Automation Testing is to ensure that when filling-in the form (or when trying to send an empty form), only when/if the information is populated correctly the form is sent, otherwise it is not possible to proceed. 
  
- Models Automation Testing: The aim of the Models Automation Testing is to ensure that when filling-in the information in the database, those are available. 


### **Additional Tests**
Tests have been performed on Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Chrome and Safari and the result is consistent in all the browsers. 

Additional tests include checks on different devices using the Toggle Device Emulation in Firefox and Microsoft Edge. Below the list of devices used for the tests through the Responsive Design Mode in Firefox is shown:
* iPhone 12 Pro Max
* iPad Pro
* iPad 
* Moto 4G
* Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
* Surface Duo

### **Bugs**
- No other bugs, other than the ones described in Agile Board (Issues: [#113](https://github.com/CCrocilla/horizon-shop/issues/113) and [#124](https://github.com/CCrocilla/horizon-shop/issues/124) ), have been found in the website during the test phase. The Issue #124 has already been fixed while regarding issue #113 a fix could not be implemented due to timing constraints.  This will be sorted in future releases.


### **Future Implementation**
A million of additional features are ready to be implemented in the future to offer a better user experience and better services thorough the Horizon Shop website. Unfortunately, due to time constraints not all the desired features have been implemented. Example of those are listed below and will be implemented in future releases:

- Out of Stock Functionality: 
The Out of Stock Functionality will indicate when a product is out of stock, to do this the quantity of each item needs to be included. If the requested quantity is larger than the available products, a message will inform the customer that that particular item is out of stock. This will be implemented for new and used products, with selling customers able to indicate the quantity they want to sell.

- Multi Image per Products
Implement the management of multi images per product. This will increase the selling possibilities of each product. 

- Analytics Data and Dashboarding
To collect information of each sold product including the numbers of the orders placed to calculate the revenue of the website. This information will be displayed using dashboards and graphs to gain insights on the spending habits of the customers and to highlight favourite and most sought products or categories. 

- Reward Points
Users that sell or buy products should receive rewards point that can be used to redeem prices (for example, customers can use reward points to redeem discounts).

- Quantity Products
Users should be able to select the quantity of the desired products before adding them to the cart. 
 
- Admin Orders Management
Admin Users should be able to change the status of the Orders and provide a feedback to the user if the order has been shipped or delivered. Information should be displayed to the Customer. 

Many other functionalities to implement!
